# Optimistic Data Fetching with Tanstack Query

This is a POC to demonstrate how to use the [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) library to implement optimistic data fetching in a Vue application.

Here is a good definition by the Remix Team:

> **Optimistic UI**: Optimistic UI enhances perceived speed and responsiveness by immediately updating the UI with an expected state before the server's response is received. This approach is used when the application can predict the outcome of an action based on context and user input, allowing for an immediate response to actions.
